# humanmouse.py - by Ben
Create a psuedo human mouse using pyautogui and math libraries in python3.

The basic idea is to create a human like automation of the mouse. Using math functions
and random functions we should be able to simulate human like mouse movements. This can
be expanded into clicks as well.
